1. inverse_list 
Write a function that takes a list as argument and returns the inverted direction of that 
list without using dedicated built-in functions.

Example:
	input:
		array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	output:
		array = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

def inverse_list(array):
	# insert code here
	
	return array_inverted
	
2. crossfoot
(a) Write a function that takes number as argument and returns the crossfoot or that number.
	The crossfoot of a number is the sum all the digits of a number.
(b) Make it more challenging by adding a type check in order to secure the functionality of 
	the function.
(c)	create a separate function is_int for the type check and create a working function.

Example:
	input:
		number = 456
	output:
		crossfoot = 15
		
def crossfoot(number):
	# insert code here
	
	return result

3. median
(a) Write a function that takes a arbitrary list of numbers as argument and returns the 
	median of the list without using dedicated built-in functions.
(b)	Include a type check of that list
